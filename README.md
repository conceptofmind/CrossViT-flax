## Cross ViT

<img src="./cross_vit.png" width="400px"></img>

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14899">This paper</a> proposes to have two vision transformers processing the image at different scales, cross attending to one every so often. They show improvements on top of the base vision transformer.

## Acknowledgement:
I have been greatly inspired by the brilliant code of [Dr. Phil 'Lucid' Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains). Please check out his [open-source implementations](https://github.com/lucidrains) of multiple different transformer architectures and [support](https://github.com/sponsors/lucidrains) his work.

## Usage

```python
import numpy

key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)

img = jax.random.normal(key, (1, 256, 256, 3))

v = CrossViT(
        image_size = 256,
        num_classes = 1000,
        depth = 4,               # number of multi-scale encoding blocks
        sm_dim = 192,            # high res dimension
        sm_patch_size = 16,      # high res patch size (should be smaller than lg_patch_size)
        sm_enc_depth = 2,        # high res depth
        sm_enc_heads = 8,        # high res heads
        sm_enc_mlp_dim = 2048,   # high res feedforward dimension
        lg_dim = 384,            # low res dimension
        lg_patch_size = 64,      # low res patch size
        lg_enc_depth = 3,        # low res depth
        lg_enc_heads = 8,        # low res heads
        lg_enc_mlp_dim = 2048,   # low res feedforward dimensions
        cross_attn_depth = 2,    # cross attention rounds
        cross_attn_heads = 8,    # cross attention heads
        dropout = 0.1,
        emb_dropout = 0.1
    )

init_rngs = {'params': jax.random.PRNGKey(1), 
            'dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(2), 
            'emb_dropout': jax.random.PRNGKey(3)}

params = v.init(init_rngs, img)
output = v.apply(params, img, rngs=init_rngs)
print(output.shape)

n_params_flax = sum(
    jax.tree_leaves(jax.tree_map(lambda x: numpy.prod(x.shape), params))
)
print(f"Number of parameters in Flax model: {n_params_flax}")
```

## Todo

- [x] Build model
- [ ] Implement pip installer
- [ ] Implement huggingface streaming dataloaders
- [ ] Implement training script
